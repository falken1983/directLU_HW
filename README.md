## directLU_HW
The `directLU_HW` repository contains the `MATLAB` code used for the
scientific paper [_A direct LU solver for pricing American bond
options under Hull–White
model_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042716302205) 
and the final chapter of my doctoral thesis [_Efficient methods for
calibrating and pricing interest rate
options_](https://repositorioinstitucional.ceu.es/bitstream/10637/12907/1/Efficient_Navarro_UCHCEU_Tesis_2012.pdf) 

All the code is in final stage. This code is open to be redistributed
without any kind of warranty. Please note, however, the fundamental
routines are still pending to contribute.
