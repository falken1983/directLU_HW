## directLU_HW
The `directLU_HW` repository contains the `MATLAB` code used for the:
1. Scientific paper [_A direct LU solver for pricing American bond
options under Hullâ€“White
model_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042716302205) 
, and;

2. The final chapter of my doctoral thesis [_Efficient methods for
calibrating and pricing interest rate
options_](https://repositorioinstitucional.ceu.es/bitstream/10637/12907/1/Efficient_Navarro_UCHCEU_Tesis_2012.pdf) 

All this code is in final stage. 
This code is open to be redistributed without any kind of warranty. 

Please note, however, the fundamental routines are not released yet.
